# The problem was to classify URL between "Evergreen" or "Non- Evergreen". 

# The data is in the form of .tsv files.


# Approach used:

# Pre-processing: firstly checked the correlation between labels and features, and extracting 
the feautures which affect the dependent variable (labels).

# It was found that other then features("boilerplate" and "alchemy_category") no other feature is 
affecting the dependency for the label.

# All the other features were dropped down.

# As feature: "alchemy_category" does conatins a lot of missing values, so it was also dropped.

# boilerplate is giving more information than url, so it is converted into word embeddings.

# feature "boilerplate" is cleaned up so that it can be easily fed into model for classification.

# Using Transformer architecture (BERT) from Hugging face library and TensorFlow 2.0 . Combining this two will build a powerful state of the art model for the classification task.
